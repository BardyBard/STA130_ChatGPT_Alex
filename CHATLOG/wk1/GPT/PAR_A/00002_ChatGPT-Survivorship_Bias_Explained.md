# Survivorship Bias Explained

#### You:
Hey can you explain to me what survivorship bias is?

#### ChatGPT:
Sure! Survivorship bias is a common logical error that occurs when we focus only on the successful outcomes while ignoring or discounting the failures. It's particularly relevant in situations where there's a selection process involved, such as in business, investing, or historical analysis.

For example, imagine you're studying the success stories of entrepreneurs who have made it big. If you only look at those who succeeded and examine their strategies, you might conclude that certain actions or traits are essential for success. However, you're ignoring the countless others who tried the same things and failed.

In essence, survivorship bias distorts our understanding of reality by overemphasizing the survivors, leading us to draw incorrect conclusions or make faulty decisions based on incomplete information.

One classic example comes from World War II aircraft. Engineers initially analyzed the bullet holes in returning aircraft to determine where they should reinforce the planes. They focused on the areas with the most damage, assuming these were the most vulnerable spots. However, statistician Abraham Wald pointed out that they were only considering the surviving planesâ€”they were ignoring the planes that had been shot down. Therefore, reinforcing the areas with the least damage (the areas where the returning planes weren't hit) would actually be more effective at increasing survivability.

Understanding survivorship bias is crucial for making informed decisions, especially in fields where past performance or historical data is used to inform future actions. It reminds us to consider all outcomes, not just the ones that made it through a selective process.


#### You:
Can you explain it to me in just one paragraph

#### ChatGPT:
Sure! Survivorship bias occurs when we focus solely on the successful outcomes while ignoring the failures, leading to a distorted understanding of reality. It's like looking at only the winners in a competition and assuming their strategies are the best, while disregarding the strategies of those who lost. This bias can lead to flawed decision-making because it overlooks valuable information from unsuccessful attempts, resulting in incomplete or misleading conclusions.


#### You:
Why is dissregarding the strategies of the ones who lost bad? I mean they lost so why do we care

#### ChatGPT:
Disregarding the strategies of those who lost is problematic because their failures often hold valuable lessons and insights that can help us understand what went wrong and how to improve. Analyzing both successes and failures provides a more comprehensive understanding of the factors at play in a given situation. Failure can illuminate pitfalls to avoid, mistakes to learn from, and areas where improvements can be made. By only focusing on successful outcomes, we miss out on this critical information, which can lead to repeating the same mistakes or failing to recognize potential risks. In essence, learning from failure is essential for growth and improvement, both personally and professionally.


#### You:
Can you give me an example with music of survivorship bias

#### ChatGPT:
Certainly! Let's consider the music industry. When we look at the most successful musicians, we often analyze their styles, marketing strategies, and career paths to understand what leads to success in the industry. However, this analysis might overlook the vast number of talented artists who never achieved mainstream success.

For instance, if we only study the strategies of highly successful musicians who made it big, we might conclude that certain genres, promotional tactics, or image choices are essential for success. But this overlooks the many talented artists who pursued similar paths but didn't achieve the same level of recognition.

By ignoring these "failed" musicians, we miss out on valuable insights into what doesn't work in the industry, such as ineffective marketing strategies, barriers to entry, or changing audience tastes. Understanding both the successes and failures in the music industry can provide a more nuanced perspective on what it takes to thrive as a musician and help aspiring artists make informed decisions about their careers.


#### You:
Youre only saying that we miss out on both sides of the coin if we ignore the failed musicians, but what if we only want to be a succesful musician, why would looking at the ones that failed help us? I want some specific reasoning to help me udnerstand.


#### ChatGPT:
Looking at the strategies and experiences of musicians who didn't achieve mainstream success can provide several specific benefits, even if your goal is to become a successful musician:

1. **Learning from Mistakes:** Failed musicians often encountered specific challenges or made mistakes along the way. By studying these failures, you can identify potential pitfalls to avoid in your own career. For example, you might learn about ineffective marketing approaches, poor contract negotiations, or mismanagement of resources that hindered their success.

2. **Understanding Industry Dynamics:** Examining the journeys of unsuccessful musicians can provide insights into the broader dynamics of the music industry. You can gain a better understanding of factors like changing audience preferences, industry trends, competition, and the role of luck or timing in success. This awareness can help you navigate the complexities of the industry more effectively.

3. **Inspiration and Motivation:** Learning about the struggles and perseverance of musicians who faced setbacks can be inspiring. It reminds you that setbacks are a natural part of any creative journey and that resilience and persistence are crucial qualities for success. Their stories can motivate you to keep pushing forward despite challenges.

4. **Identifying Untapped Opportunities:** Sometimes, unsuccessful musicians may have explored innovative or unconventional approaches that didn't gain traction at the time but could represent untapped opportunities in the future. By studying their experiences, you might uncover niche markets, emerging trends, or new ways to connect with audiences that mainstream success stories overlook.

In essence, studying both successful and unsuccessful musicians provides a more holistic view of the music industry. It equips you with a broader range of insights, strategies, and lessons that can inform your decisions and increase your chances of achieving your goals as a musician. Learning from others' failures can be as valuable as learning from their successes, offering a balanced perspective on what it takes to thrive in a competitive field like music.


#### You:
Are there any negatives if everyone in music only used succesful strategies?

#### ChatGPT:
Yes, there can be negatives if everyone in music only used successful strategies without considering the broader context or learning from failures:

1. **Homogeneity and Lack of Innovation:** If everyone follows the same successful strategies, there's a risk of creating a homogenized music landscape where creativity and innovation are stifled. Music thrives on diversity of styles, genres, and approaches. Embracing only proven successful strategies could lead to a lack of experimentation and diversity in musical expression.

2. **Saturation and Competition:** Adopting the same successful strategies can lead to increased competition within certain genres or approaches. This saturation can make it harder for individual musicians to stand out or find their unique voice. It may also limit opportunities for new or emerging artists who don't conform to established norms but have innovative ideas.

3. **Market Fatigue:** Over-reliance on successful strategies can result in audience fatigue or boredom. Trends and audience preferences evolve over time, and what works today may not resonate tomorrow. Relying solely on past successes without adaptation to changing tastes can lead to diminished audience engagement and relevance.

4. **Missed Opportunities for Growth:** Ignoring strategies that have not led to mainstream success can mean missing out on potential avenues for growth and development. Some of the most groundbreaking artists and movements in music history emerged from initially unconventional or niche approaches that later gained widespread acclaim.

In summary, while learning from successful strategies is important, it's equally crucial to embrace diversity, innovation, and the lessons learned from both successes and failures in order to sustain a dynamic and thriving music industry.
