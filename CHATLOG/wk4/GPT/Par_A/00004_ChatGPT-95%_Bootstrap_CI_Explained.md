# 95% Bootstrap CI Explained

#### You:
My professor has asked me to do an assignment, can you explain how we create a 95% bootstrapped confidence interval using the bootstrapped means (without using their standard deviation to estimate the standard error of the mean)? Explain this concisely 

#### ChatGPT:
Certainly! To create a 95% bootstrapped confidence interval for the mean without using the standard deviation of the bootstrap samples, follow these steps:

1. **Resample the Data**: Randomly draw, with replacement, many bootstrap samples from your original dataset. Each sample should be the same size as the original dataset.

2. **Calculate Means**: Compute the mean for each bootstrap sample.

3. **Sort the Means**: Arrange the bootstrap means in ascending order.

4. **Determine the Percentiles**: Find the 2.5th percentile and the 97.5th percentile of the sorted bootstrap means. These percentiles will be your lower and upper bounds, respectively, for the 95% confidence interval.

So, the 95% confidence interval is given by the range between these two percentiles of the bootstrap means.


#### You:
Can you write the code for this in python and pandas

#### ChatGPT:
Certainly! Below is a concise example of how you can create a 95% bootstrapped confidence interval for the mean using Python with `pandas` and `numpy`.

```python
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd

# Example data
data = pd.Series([your, data, here])  # Replace with your actual data

# Parameters
n_bootstrap_samples = 10000  # Number of bootstrap samples

# Function to calculate the mean of bootstrap samples
def bootstrap_mean(data, n_samples):
    means = []
    for _ in range(n_samples):
        sample = data.sample(frac=1, replace=True)  # Resample with replacement
        means.append(sample.mean())
    return np.array(means)

# Generate bootstrap means
bootstrap_means = bootstrap_mean(data, n_bootstrap_samples)

# Calculate the 95% confidence interval
lower_bound = np.percentile(bootstrap_means, 2.5)
upper_bound = np.percentile(bootstrap_means, 97.5)

print(f"95% Confidence Interval: ({lower_bound:.4f}, {upper_bound:.4f})")
```

### Explanation:

1. **Generate Bootstrap Samples**: We resample the data with replacement and compute the mean of each sample.
2. **Calculate Percentiles**: We use `np.percentile` to find the 2.5th and 97.5th percentiles of the bootstrap means to determine the confidence interval.

Replace `[your, data, here]` with your actual data values to use this code with your dataset.


#### You:
Give me some sample data to fill in

#### ChatGPT:
Sure! Hereâ€™s an example with sample data for you to use:

```python
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd

# Sample data
data = pd.Series([12, 15, 14, 10, 18, 17, 13, 16, 19, 11])

# Parameters
n_bootstrap_samples = 10000  # Number of bootstrap samples

# Function to calculate the mean of bootstrap samples
def bootstrap_mean(data, n_samples):
    means = []
    for _ in range(n_samples):
        sample = data.sample(frac=1, replace=True)  # Resample with replacement
        means.append(sample.mean())
    return np.array(means)

# Generate bootstrap means
bootstrap_means = bootstrap_mean(data, n_bootstrap_samples)

# Calculate the 95% confidence interval
lower_bound = np.percentile(bootstrap_means, 2.5)
upper_bound = np.percentile(bootstrap_means, 97.5)

print(f"95% Confidence Interval: ({lower_bound:.4f}, {upper_bound:.4f})")
```

In this example, the `data` Series contains ten sample values. This code will calculate the 95% confidence interval for the mean based on these values.


#### You:
Give me the code to generate a normal distribution so I can use it as adata

#### ChatGPT:
Certainly! You can generate a sample dataset from a normal distribution using `numpy`. Here's how you can do it:

```python
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd

# Parameters for the normal distribution
mean = 50     # Mean of the distribution
std_dev = 10  # Standard deviation of the distribution
size = 100    # Number of samples

# Generate the data
data = np.random.normal(loc=mean, scale=std_dev, size=size)

# Convert to pandas Series
data_series = pd.Series(data)

print(data_series.head())  # Print the first few entries to check the data
```

### Explanation:

- `mean`: The mean of the normal distribution.
- `std_dev`: The standard deviation of the normal distribution.
- `size`: The number of samples you want to generate.

This will create a `data_series` with 100 samples drawn from a normal distribution with the specified mean and standard deviation. You can then use this `data_series` in the bootstrapping code provided earlier.
