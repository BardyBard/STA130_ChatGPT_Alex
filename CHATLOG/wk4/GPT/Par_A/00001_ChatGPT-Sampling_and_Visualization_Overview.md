# Sampling and Visualization Overview

#### You:
I have this code from my professor, can you just succinctly explain to me the general process of the code and its output without going into the weeds

from scipy import stats
import numpy as np

# Population
population_parameter_mu_μ = 0
population_parameter_sigma_σ = 1
normal_distribution = stats.norm(loc=population_parameter_mu_μ, 
                                 scale=population_parameter_sigma_σ) 
# Sample
n = 100 # adjust and experiment with this
# np.random.seed(130)
x = normal_distribution.rvs(size=n) # "x" is the sample of size "n"
# print(x) # uncomment this if you also want to see the sample 

# Mean
print("The sample mean for the current sample is", x.mean()) 
# the sample mean "x-bar" is a (sample) "statistic" (not a "parameter")
# "x-bar" is the "average" of the numbers in a sample
# This code visualizes the population being sampled from (as a red line),
# a sample from this population (as a histogram), and the sample mean

#### ChatGPT:
Sure! Here’s a succinct overview of what this code does:

1. **Define a Normal Distribution**: It sets up a normal distribution with a mean (μ) of 0 and a standard deviation (σ) of 1 using `scipy.stats.norm`.

2. **Generate a Sample**: It creates a sample of size `n` (100 in this case) from this normal distribution.

3. **Calculate the Sample Mean**: It calculates and prints the mean of the generated sample.

In summary, the code generates a random sample from a normal distribution and computes the average of that sample. The output is the sample mean.


#### You:
Can you now explain to me succinctly what this code does?

# What is this doing?

number_of_simulations = 1000 # adjust and experiment with this
simulated_means = np.zeros(number_of_simulations)

# np.random.seed(130) # ?
n = 100 # adjust and experiment with this
for i in range(number_of_simulations):
    # np.random.seed(130) # ?
    simulated_means[i] = stats.norm(loc=0, scale=1).rvs(size=n).mean()

#### ChatGPT:
Certainly! This code performs the following steps:

1. **Setup**: It initializes an array `simulated_means` to store the means of multiple simulations.

2. **Simulate Multiple Samples**: It runs a loop `number_of_simulations` times (1000 in this case). In each iteration, it:
   - Generates a sample of size `n` (100) from a normal distribution with mean 0 and standard deviation 1.
   - Computes the mean of this sample and stores it in the `simulated_means` array.

In essence, the code simulates 1000 samples from a normal distribution, calculates the mean of each sample, and stores these means in an array.


#### You:
What is the difference between the two versions of code?

#### ChatGPT:
The two versions of code have different purposes and functionalities. Here is a succinct comparison:

### First Version:

- **Single Sample**: Generates a single sample of size `n` from a normal distribution.
- **Single Mean Calculation**: Computes and prints the mean of this single sample.
- **Output**: The sample mean for that single sample.

### Second Version:

- **Multiple Simulations**: Repeats the process of generating samples and calculating their means multiple times (`number_of_simulations` times).
- **Array of Means**: Stores the means of these multiple samples in an array `simulated_means`.
- **Output**: An array of sample means, representing the distribution of means from many samples.

### Key Differences:

1. **Purpose**:
   - The first code snippet is designed to demonstrate and calculate the mean of a single sample.
   - The second code snippet is designed to perform multiple simulations to analyze the distribution of sample means.

2. **Number of Samples**:
   - The first snippet deals with one sample.
   - The second snippet deals with `number_of_simulations` samples (1000 samples).

3. **Output**:
   - The first snippet outputs a single mean.
   - The second snippet outputs an array of means from multiple simulations.

4. **Looping**:
   - The first snippet does not use a loop.
   - The second snippet uses a loop to generate multiple samples and compute their means.

Both snippets are useful for different types of statistical analysis: the first for understanding the mean of a single sample, and the second for understanding the variability and distribution of sample means through repeated sampling.


#### You:
Can you now explain what this version of the code does?

# And in order to repeatedly simulate samples (means) like the ones we have, let's
# FALSELY pretend the population parameters are their corresponding statistics
country = 'Mexico<br>(n=236)'

PRETEND_population_parameter_mu_μ_is_sample_mean = df[df.origin==country].points.mean()
PRETEND_population_parameter_sigma_σ_is_sample_std = df[df.origin==country].points.std()

n = (df.origin==country).sum()

print("PRETENDING that the population mean μ is", PRETEND_population_parameter_mu_μ_is_sample_mean)
print("and the population standard deviation σ is", PRETEND_population_parameter_sigma_σ_is_sample_std)
print("we can repeatedly draw samples of size", n, "and compute their means...")
# What is this doing?

number_of_simulations = 1000 # adjust and experiment with this
simulated_means = np.zeros(number_of_simulations)

# np.random.seed(130) # ?
for i in range(number_of_simulations):
    simulated_means[i] = stats.norm(loc=PRETEND_population_parameter_mu_μ_is_sample_mean,
                                    scale=PRETEND_population_parameter_sigma_σ_is_sample_std).rvs(size=n).mean()

#### ChatGPT:
Certainly! This code performs the following steps:

1. **Set Up Population Parameters**:
   - It calculates the sample mean and standard deviation from a specific dataset (for a country, in this case, "Mexico").
   - These calculated values are used as if they were the true population parameters. The mean (`PRETEND_population_parameter_mu_μ_is_sample_mean`) and standard deviation (`PRETEND_population_parameter_sigma_σ_is_sample_std`) are extracted from the dataset for the specified country.

2. **Simulate Multiple Samples**:
   - It runs a loop `number_of_simulations` times (1000 in this case). For each iteration:
     - It generates a sample of size `n` (the number of data points for the specified country) from a normal distribution with the pretended mean and standard deviation.
     - Computes the mean of this sample and stores it in the `simulated_means` array.

3. **Output**:
   - Prints the pretended population mean and standard deviation.
   - Outputs an array of means from these simulated samples, representing how the means would vary if samples were repeatedly drawn from a normal distribution with the pretended parameters.

### Key Differences from Previous Codes:

1. **Using Dataset Values**:
   - This code uses actual data to estimate the mean and standard deviation for a specific group (e.g., "Mexico") and pretends these are the true population parameters.

2. **Simulation with Pretended Parameters**:
   - It simulates samples from a normal distribution defined by these estimated parameters rather than the standard normal distribution used in the previous codes.

3. **Contextual Output**:
   - It provides a context-specific simulation (for a particular country and its data), and the output represents the variability of sample means under the assumption that the estimated statistics are the true population parameters.

Can you now explain what this code does and the difference?

# population
pop_parameter_alpha_α = 2
pop_parameter_theta_θ = 4
gamma_distribution = stats.gamma(a=pop_parameter_alpha_α, scale=pop_parameter_theta_θ)

# sample
n = 100 # adjust and experiment with this
# np.random.seed(130)
x = gamma_distribution.rvs(size=n) # "x" is a sample
# print(x)

# mean
print("The sample mean for the current sample is", x.mean()) 
# the sample mean "x-bar" is a (sample) "statistic" (not a "parameter")
# "x-bar" is the "average" of the numbers in a sample

#### ChatGPT:
Here's a summary of what this code does and how it differs from the previous examples:

### What This Code Does:

1. **Define a Gamma Distribution**:
   - Sets up a gamma distribution with shape parameter `α` (alpha) of 2 and scale parameter `θ` (theta) of 4 using `scipy.stats.gamma`.

2. **Generate a Sample**:
   - Creates a sample of size `n` (100 in this case) from the gamma distribution.

3. **Calculate the Sample Mean**:
   - Computes and prints the mean of this sample.

### Key Differences from Previous Codes:

1. **Distribution Type**:
   - This code uses a gamma distribution (`stats.gamma`) instead of a normal distribution.
   - The gamma distribution is different from the normal distribution and is characterized by its shape and scale parameters, while the normal distribution is characterized by its mean and standard deviation.

2. **Parameters**:
   - The gamma distribution is defined by `α` (shape parameter) and `θ` (scale parameter), whereas the normal distribution is defined by the mean and standard deviation.

3. **Output**:
   - As with previous examples, the code calculates and prints the sample mean, but it does so for a sample drawn from a gamma distribution rather than a normal distribution.

In essence, this code demonstrates how to generate a sample from a gamma distribution and compute its mean, contrasting with the earlier examples that used a normal distribution.


#### You:
I dont understand the difference between the normal and gamma distrubtion

#### ChatGPT:
Certainly! Here’s a clear comparison between the normal and gamma distributions:

### **Normal Distribution**

1. **Shape**:
   - **Bell-Shaped Curve**: Symmetric around the mean.
   - **Parameters**:
     - **Mean (μ)**: Center of the distribution.
     - **Standard Deviation (σ)**: Determines the spread or width of the curve.
   - **Properties**:
     - **Symmetry**: The normal distribution is symmetric around its mean.
     - **Empirical Rule**: About 68% of the data falls within ±1σ, 95% within ±2σ, and 99.7% within ±3σ.
     - **Range**: Can take any real value, from negative to positive infinity.
   - **Applications**: Commonly used in natural and social sciences for modeling continuous data.

2. **Example**:
   - Heights of people, IQ scores, errors in measurements.

### **Gamma Distribution**

1. **Shape**:
   - **Skewed and Asymmetric**: The shape can vary from skewed to nearly symmetric, depending on its parameters.
   - **Parameters**:
     - **Shape Parameter (α)**: Determines the shape of the distribution.
     - **Scale Parameter (θ)**: Scales the distribution.
   - **Properties**:
     - **Skewness**: The gamma distribution is typically skewed to the right, especially when α is small.
     - **Range**: Only positive values (0 to ∞), meaning it can't take negative values.
   - **Applications**: Used to model waiting times, lifetimes, and other non-negative continuous data.

2. **Example**:
   - Time until a machine breaks down, waiting time for an event to occur.

### **Visual and Practical Differences**

- **Shape and Symmetry**:
  - **Normal**: Symmetric, bell-shaped.
  - **Gamma**: Skewed (often to the right), can vary from skewed to nearly symmetric.

- **Range of Values**:
  - **Normal**: Any real number (positive or negative).
  - **Gamma**: Only positive values.

- **Use Cases**:
  - **Normal**: Ideal for data that clusters around a central value.
  - **Gamma**: Suitable for modeling the distribution of non-negative variables, especially those that exhibit skewness.

In summary, while the normal distribution is useful for modeling symmetric data around a central value, the gamma distribution is more flexible for modeling non-negative data that might be skewed.


#### You:
Can you now succinctly explain what this version is doing and how it differs from the previous versions?

# what is this doing?

number_of_simulations = 1000 # adjust and experiment with this
simulated_means = np.zeros(number_of_simulations)

# np.random.seed(130) # ?
n = 100 # adjust and experiment with this

for i in range(number_of_simulations):
    # np.random.seed(130) # ?
    simulated_means[i] = gamma_distribution.rvs(size=n).mean()

#### ChatGPT:
Certainly! Here’s a succinct explanation:

### What This Code Does:

1. **Set Up Simulation**:
   - Defines `number_of_simulations` as 1000 and initializes an array `simulated_means` to store the means from each simulation.

2. **Simulate Multiple Samples**:
   - In a loop that runs 1000 times:
     - Generates a sample of size `n` (100) from a gamma distribution defined earlier.
     - Computes the mean of this sample and stores it in the `simulated_means` array.

### Key Differences from Previous Versions:

1. **Distribution Type**:
   - Uses a gamma distribution (`gamma_distribution`) to generate samples, whereas previous codes used a normal distribution.

2. **Simulation Context**:
   - Similar to earlier codes, this code performs multiple simulations to compute sample means, but it does so for a gamma distribution rather than a normal distribution.

3. **Parameter Use**:
   - Unlike the previous examples where parameters were either hardcoded or derived from specific data, this code uses a pre-defined gamma distribution with specific shape and scale parameters (`pop_parameter_alpha_α` and `pop_parameter_theta_θ`).

In summary, this code performs 1000 simulations to generate sample means from a gamma distribution, focusing on the variability of sample means for a gamma distribution compared to the normal distribution in previous examples.


#### You:
Can you now do the same explanation for this code:

country = 'Mexico<br>(n=236)' 

# bootstrapping is when `replace=True` and `n` is the original sample size
# and we do this over and over to see the behavior of sample statistics
n_ = (df.origin==country).sum() # This is the correct choice for bootstrapping, but why?
replace_ = True # This is the correct choice for bootstrapping, but why?

# We don't have a "poulation" any more... only the (original) "Sample"
x = df[df.origin==country].sample(n=n_, replace=replace_).points
# print(x)
print("The bootstrap sample mean for the current bootstrapped sample is", x.mean()) 

#### ChatGPT:
### What This Code Does:

1. **Define the Country and Sample Size**:
   - Sets the `country` to "Mexico" and identifies the sample size `n_` from this country in the DataFrame `df`.

2. **Bootstrapping Setup**:
   - **Replace**: `replace=True` allows for sampling with replacement, which is a key characteristic of bootstrapping.
   - **Sample Size**: `n_` is set to the size of the original sample, ensuring that each bootstrap sample has the same size as the original sample.

3. **Generate a Bootstrap Sample**:
   - Uses the `.sample()` method to create a bootstrap sample from the original sample for the specified country, sampling with replacement.
   - Calculates and prints the mean of this bootstrap sample.

### Why These Choices?

1. **Sample Size (`n_`)**:
   - **Reason**: Bootstrapping aims to mimic the original sample's size to estimate the sampling distribution of a statistic. Using `n_` ensures that each bootstrap sample reflects the original sample's size, making the bootstrap process valid.

2. **Replacement (`replace=True`)**:
   - **Reason**: Bootstrapping requires sampling with replacement to create multiple independent samples from the original data. This simulates the process of drawing new samples from the original sample, allowing for the estimation of the distribution of sample statistics.

### Key Differences from Previous Versions:

1. **Bootstrapping Method**:
   - Instead of generating samples from a theoretical distribution (like normal or gamma), this code creates bootstrap samples from the actual data (the original sample).

2. **Focus on Sample Statistics**:
   - It calculates the mean of the bootstrap sample, which helps estimate the variability of the mean or other statistics from the original sample.

3. **No Theoretical Distribution**:
   - The code does not use predefined distributions (normal or gamma) but rather resamples from the real data, reflecting the original sample's characteristics.

In summary, this code performs bootstrapping by resampling the original data with replacement and calculating the mean of each bootstrap sample to assess the variability and distribution of the sample mean.


#### You:
Can you lastly explain what this version of the code does?

# what is this doing?

number_of_simulations = 1000 # adjust and experiment with this
simulated_means = np.zeros(number_of_simulations)

# np.random.seed(130) # ?
n_ = 100 # adjust and experiment with this # 236 #

# ...not sure what it would then be called... 

replace_ = True # ? ... what would happen if the bootstrap sample size n_ 
# was the same size as the origina sample size n, and this was `False`?

for i in range(number_of_simulations):
    simulated_means[i] = df[df.origin==country].sample(n=n_, replace=replace_).points.mean()

#### ChatGPT:
Here’s a succinct explanation of what this code does and how it differs from previous versions:

### What This Code Does:

1. **Set Up Simulation**:
   - Defines `number_of_simulations` as 1000 and initializes an array `simulated_means` to store the means from each simulation.

2. **Bootstrapping Setup**:
   - **Sample Size (`n_`)**: Set to 100, which is the size of each bootstrap sample.
   - **Replacement (`replace_`)**: Set to `True`, meaning sampling is done with replacement, which is typical for bootstrapping.

3. **Perform Simulations**:
   - In a loop that runs 1000 times:
     - For each iteration, it creates a bootstrap sample by resampling from the data for the specified country (`df[df.origin==country]`).
     - Computes the mean of this bootstrap sample and stores it in the `simulated_means` array.

### Key Points and Differences:

1. **Bootstrap Sampling**:
   - **Replacement**: Sampling with replacement (`replace=True`) allows for creating multiple independent bootstrap samples from the original data, reflecting the variability of the sample mean.
   - **Sample Size (`n_`)**: Unlike traditional bootstrapping where the sample size is the same as the original sample size, this code uses a fixed sample size of 100 for each bootstrap sample.

2. **Not True Bootstrapping**:
   - **Mismatch in Sample Size**: Since `n_` is set to 100 instead of the actual sample size for the country (e.g., 236), this process is not strictly bootstrapping. True bootstrapping would use the original sample size to create samples.
   - **Effect of `replace=False`**: If `replace` were `False`, the code would be performing a sampling without replacement, which is not bootstrapping. It would be creating a new sample of size `n_` each time, but without repeating any observations within that sample.

3. **Comparison to Previous Versions**:
   - **Simulation Setup**: Similar to the previous codes, this code performs multiple simulations but uses real data for resampling rather than generating samples from theoretical distributions.
   - **Bootstrap vs. Other Sampling**: This code resembles bootstrapping but uses a different sample size than the original data, so it’s not a true bootstrap procedure.

### Summary:

This code performs a simulation where it repeatedly resamples from a dataset with replacement, computes the mean of each sample, and stores the results. The key difference from true bootstrapping is that it uses a fixed sample size of 100 rather than resampling the full size of the original dataset.
