# SEM vs SD Differences

#### You:
Can you explain to me how the "standard error of the mean" means being the "standard deviation" of the distribution bootstrapped means. What is the difference between the "standard error of the mean" and the "standard deviation" of the original data? What hypothetical idea do each of these capture? Explain this concisely 

#### ChatGPT:
Certainly! Here’s a concise explanation:

**Standard Error of the Mean (SEM):**

- **Definition:** SEM is the standard deviation of the sample means when you repeatedly sample from a population and compute the mean of each sample.
- **Purpose:** It estimates how much the sample mean is expected to vary from the true population mean. Essentially, it reflects the precision of the sample mean as an estimate of the population mean.
- **Formula:** SEM = σ / √n, where σ is the standard deviation of the population and n is the sample size.

**Standard Deviation of the Original Data (SD):**

- **Definition:** SD measures the dispersion of individual data points from the sample mean in the original data set.
- **Purpose:** It reflects the variability or spread of the data within a single sample.
- **Formula:** SD = √\[ Σ(xi - x̄)² / (n - 1) ], where xi represents each data point, x̄ is the sample mean, and n is the sample size.

**Differences:**

- **SEM** describes how much the sample mean is likely to differ from the true population mean, focusing on the variability of means across different samples.
- **SD** describes how individual data points vary around the sample mean, focusing on the dispersion within a single data set.

**Hypothetical Idea:**

- **SEM** captures the reliability of the sample mean as an estimate of the population mean.
- **SD** captures the variability of the data points themselves within a sample.

In short, SEM provides insight into how sample means are expected to vary from the population mean, while SD gives a sense of the spread of data points around their own sample mean.


#### You:
Our professors suggested that the "standard error of the mean" could be used to create a confidence interval, but didn't describe exactly how to do this. How can we use the "standard error of the mean" to create a 95% confidence interval which "covers 95% of the bootstrapped sample means"? Explain this concisely 

#### ChatGPT:
To create a 95% confidence interval using the Standard Error of the Mean (SEM) and cover 95% of bootstrapped sample means, follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the SEM:**\
   $ \text{SEM} = \frac{\text{SD}}{\sqrt{n}} $\
   where SD is the standard deviation of your original data and n is the sample size.

2. **Determine the critical value for 95% confidence:**\
   For a 95% confidence interval, you typically use a critical value from the standard normal distribution, which is approximately 1.96 for large samples. This value corresponds to the z-score that covers 95% of the distribution.

3. **Compute the confidence interval:**\
   $ \text{Confidence Interval} = \bar{x} \pm (1.96 \times \text{SEM}) $\
   where $\bar{x}$ is the sample mean.

**Bootstrapped Sample Means:**
To cover 95% of bootstrapped sample means, you can:

1. **Generate bootstrapped samples:** Repeatedly draw samples with replacement from your original data and calculate the mean for each bootstrapped sample.

2. **Find percentiles:** Sort the bootstrapped means and determine the 2.5th percentile and the 97.5th percentile. These percentiles form the bounds of your 95% confidence interval for the mean.

**Summary:**

- Use SEM and a critical value to compute a confidence interval if you assume a normal distribution.
- Use bootstrapped percentiles to directly determine the interval from the empirical distribution of bootstrapped means.

Both methods aim to provide an interval within which the true population mean is expected to fall with 95% confidence.


#### You:
How can I determine the critival value for 95% confidence myself? Im using python and pandas

#### ChatGPT:
To determine the critical value for a 95% confidence interval in Python, you can use the `scipy.stats` library, which provides functions for statistical distributions. Here's how you can do it:

1. **Install `scipy` if you haven't already:**

   ```bash
   pip install scipy
   ```

2. **Import the necessary functions:**

   ```python
   from scipy.stats import norm
   ```

3. **Determine the critical value:**

   For a 95% confidence interval, you need the critical value corresponding to the middle 95% of the normal distribution. This leaves 2.5% in each tail.

   ```python
   # For a 95% confidence interval, the critical value is the z-score at 97.5%
   critical_value = norm.ppf(0.975)
   print(f'Critical value for 95% confidence interval: {critical_value}')
   ```

   This will give you the critical z-value, which is approximately 1.96.

**Explanation:**

- `norm.ppf(0.975)` calculates the z-score corresponding to the 97.5th percentile of the standard normal distribution. This is because for a 95% confidence interval, you want to cover 95% in the middle, leaving 5% in the tails (2.5% in each tail).

**Example:**

Here’s a complete example showing how to use this critical value to calculate a 95% confidence interval:

```python
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
from scipy.stats import norm

# Sample data
data = pd.Series([23, 21, 25, 24, 30, 28, 29, 31])

# Calculate sample mean and standard deviation
mean = data.mean()
std_dev = data.std()
n = len(data)

# Calculate Standard Error of the Mean (SEM)
sem = std_dev / np.sqrt(n)

# Get the critical value for a 95% confidence interval
critical_value = norm.ppf(0.975)

# Calculate the confidence interval
margin_of_error = critical_value * sem
confidence_interval = (mean - margin_of_error, mean + margin_of_error)

print(f'Mean: {mean}')
print(f'Standard Error of the Mean: {sem}')
print(f'Critical Value: {critical_value}')
print(f'95% Confidence Interval: {confidence_interval}')
```

This code calculates the mean, standard deviation, and SEM, and then computes the 95% confidence interval using the critical z-value.
